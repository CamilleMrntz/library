Personal project to consolidate my competences in PHP.

This project aims to build a social media about books.
The goal is to have all books and resumes on the platform (collected on Amazon maybe ?)
So that users can have their own digital lists of what they have read and what they want to read and even add some comments on each books.
The platform will not sell books. Only contains titles of the book, their resumes and a picture of the cover.

Functionnalities wanted :
- Be able to connect/disconnect 
- Be able to add books in an "already read" list
- Be able to add books in an "want to read" list
- Be able to comment or add descriptions on the books added in their personnal lists
- Be able to look for books by themes, authors or dates
- Be able to follow friends or other persons to see their lists and comments 
- Be able to like or dislike books
